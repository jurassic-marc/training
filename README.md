## How to use this project

Instructions are in the booklet. In short:

* Create your own GitHub account with SSH keypair
* Fork this project
* Clone your own repository
* Create a new Eclipse Java project that uses the source code contained in the clone
* Edit, commit, push to demonstrate GitHub.
* Enable and configure Travis
* Edit, commit, push to demonstrate Travis and testing.

## How this project was created

1. Create a new repository
2. Clone it
  * SSH keys make it easier to push subsequently
3. Create an Eclipse project in that location
4. Add an appropriate `.gitignore` file
  * I used this [Eclipse template](https://www.gitignore.io/api/eclipse) from https://www.gitignore.io
5. Edit, commit, push.

I also enabled and tested Travis in another repository to make sure the tests worked. That configuration and effect is not reflected here, but is demonstrated in the booklet.
